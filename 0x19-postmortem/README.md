Issue Summary:

On March 1st, 2023, between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM EST, the online banking service for our customers experienced an outage. During this time, users were unable to access their accounts or make transactions. Approximately 75% of our users were affected by this outage. The root cause of the outage was a hardware failure in one of our servers.

Timeline:

10:00 AM EST: The issue was detected by our monitoring system, which alerted our on-call engineer.
10:05 AM EST: The engineer investigated the issue and found that the online banking service was not responding.
10:10 AM EST: The engineer notified the incident response team and began investigating the cause of the issue.
10:20 AM EST: The team started investigating the network, database, and application layers to identify the root cause of the issue.
11:00 AM EST: The team identified a potential issue with the server hardware and began investigating further.
12:00 PM EST: The team attempted to restart the server, but it did not resolve the issue.
12:30 PM EST: The team escalated the incident to our senior engineers and management team for further assistance.
1:00 PM EST: The senior engineers identified a hardware failure in one of our servers as the root cause of the issue.
1:30 PM EST: The senior engineers replaced the faulty hardware and verified that the service was restored.
2:00 PM EST: The online banking service was fully restored, and users were able to access their accounts and make transactions.

Root cause and resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a hardware failure in one of our servers. Specifically, the server's power supply unit had failed, causing the server to shut down. To resolve the issue, the faulty power supply unit was replaced with a new one, and the server was brought back online. Additionally, we implemented a more robust hardware monitoring system to catch similar issues in the future.

Corrective and preventative measures:

To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we will be implementing the following corrective and preventative measures:

Perform regular hardware maintenance and replacements as part of our standard operating procedures.
Increase the frequency of hardware monitoring to detect issues before they cause service disruptions.
Improve our incident response processes to allow for faster resolution of issues.
Implement redundant hardware systems to provide failover capabilities in case of hardware failures.
Provide more training to our engineering and operations teams on how to quickly diagnose and resolve hardware issues.

In conclusion, we apologize for the inconvenience caused to our users during this outage. We take this incident seriously and are taking measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
